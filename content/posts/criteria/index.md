Seattle Park Radar uses the following criteria to rate and evaluate playgrounds in the Seattle area. These ratings and evaluations are based on opinion. This post will explain the individual components I use to rate and evaluate.


*Address*: The physical location of the playground, searchable on maps.

*Overall impression*: How I felt overall about the playground.

*Visibility*: How easy it is to see children at the playground. Specifically, does the adult have to move in order to see the child? Rating system out of 10 with 1 being poor visibility and 10 being excellent visibility. 

*Parking*: What the parking situation is like and if there is a parking lot available.

*Bathrooms*: Are there bathrooms at the park? How close to the playground?

*Shade availability*: Is there shade available?

*Special seasonal features*: Some playgrounds have special seasonal features like spray parks or wading pools, these will be listed here.

*Nearby amenities*: If there are any coffee shops, bakeries or stores nearby within walking distance.

*What the structure(s) are like*: What materials is the playground actually made out of? What features are actually at the playground (slides, swings, monkey bars etc.)

*Other features*: Any other notable features will be added here, including but not limited to if the playground is fenced, if there are fields nearby, if there is parent seating and picnic tables.

*Playground website*: Where you can go for additional information provided by the city.
